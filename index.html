# RX Boss – Florida Prescribed Burn GO / NO-GO

RX Boss is a lightweight, single-file web tool designed to support **Florida prescribed burn bosses** with rapid, defensible GO / CAUTION / NO-GO decisions.

The tool consumes **live National Weather Service (NWS) Gridpoint data** for each burn compartment, evaluates worst-case fire-behavior conditions over the next 24 hours, and clearly explains *why* a unit is recommended or disqualified.

## Key Principles
- **Never fake weather**  
  If live NWS data is unavailable or incomplete, the unit is automatically marked **NO-GO** with a clear “WEATHER UNKNOWN” explanation.

- **Zero keys, zero installs**  
  Runs entirely in the browser. No API keys, servers, or build steps.

- **Single-file deployment**  
  One `index.html` file. Works locally or hosted via GitHub Pages.

- **Burn-boss trust first**  
  Every decision is transparent, conservative, and traceable to NWS grid data.

## How It Works
1. User drags in a GeoJSON of burn compartments (Florida CRS / WGS84).
2. The tool computes each compartment’s centroid.
3. Live NWS Gridpoint data is fetched for:
   - Temperature
   - Relative humidity
   - Sustained wind
   - Wind gusts
   - Wind direction
   - Mixing height
   - Forecast precipitation (QPF)
4. Worst-case values for the next 24 hours are evaluated.
5. Each unit is labeled:
   - **GO**
   - **CAUTION**
   - **NO-GO**
6. Cards display **LIVE / CACHED / OFFLINE** status with timestamps.

## Decision Logic (Florida-Focused)
**GO envelope**
- RH: 30–55%
- Wind: 5–15 mph
- Gusts ≤20 mph
- Mixing height ≥1700 ft

**CAUTION**
- RH 25–29% or 56–60%
- Wind 16–18 mph
- Gusts 21–25 mph
- Mixing height 1200–1699 ft

**NO-GO**
- RH <25% or >60%
- Wind >18 mph
- Gusts >25 mph
- Mixing height <1200 ft
- Any missing or offline weather variable

## Data Integrity
- Uses **NWS forecastGridData only** (no text forecasts)
- Correctly parses NWS `validTime` intervals
- Converts all units to:
  - °F
  - mph
  - feet
  - inches
- Clearly labels **Forecast QPF** (no false “hours since rain” claims)

## Offline & Caching Behavior
- Local cache (6–12 hours) per compartment
- Explicit badges:
  - **LIVE**
  - **CACHED @ time**
  - **OFFLINE**
- Offline or blocked data always results in **NO-GO**

## Intended Use
Decision **support**, not automation.  
Designed to augment professional judgment and provide defensible, explainable weather screening for prescribed fire planning on Florida state lands.

## Hosting
This project is intended to be hosted via **GitHub Pages** to avoid browser CORS restrictions when accessing NWS APIs.
